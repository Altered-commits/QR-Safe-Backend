# QR-Safe-Backend
### A really basic backend for our hackathon project. Currently it can check for malicious URL.
### Frontend is made by my other teammates.

# Routes
#### 1) POST - /api/check-url
- Payload: { url: "some_url" }
- Response: { safe: boolean, message: "diagnostics_message" }

### Yeah, that is all. Quite a simple backend for now.
